the cat sat on the mat
the dog ran in the park
i like to eat apples
she reads books every day
he plays soccer on weekends
the sun rises in the east
water flows down the hill
birds fly in the sky
fish swim in the ocean
trees grow tall and strong
the moon shines at night
students study hard for exams
teachers help students learn
flowers bloom in spring
snow falls in winter
rain makes plants grow
wind blows through trees
clouds float across the sky
stars twinkle at night
the earth orbits the sun
people walk on sidewalks
cars drive on roads
planes fly high above
boats sail on water
trains run on tracks
music makes people happy
art brings joy to life
science explains nature
math helps solve problems
history teaches us lessons
